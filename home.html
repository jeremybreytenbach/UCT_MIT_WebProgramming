	<li>Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where poverty has increased in the past 25 years.</li>
	<li>33 million primary school-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa do not go to school. 18 million of these children are girls.</li>
	<li>In Sub-Saharan Africa, only two-thirds of children who start primary school reach the final grade.</li>
	<li>Approximately 40% of Africans over the age of 15, and 50% of women above the age of 25 are illiterate.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading">Is there hope?</h2>
	<p>Where there is a will, there is a way, but what is the way?</p>
	<ul>
	<li>There must be significant investment in training existing teachers and recruiting more teachers with excellent skills, particularly in Maths and Science. </li>
	<li>We must also explore the feasibility of bringing back teacher training colleges, and making it easier for excellent teachers from other countries to help plug skills gaps in our education system.</li>
	<li>Parents should be empowered through a voucher system which will give parents a greater say over their children's education. </li>
	<li>Instead of funding going to schools as it does now, funding should follow the child.</li>
	</ul>
