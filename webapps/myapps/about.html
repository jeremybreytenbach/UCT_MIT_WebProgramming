equip learners to matriculate in mathematics and science. We are a non-profit organization
established in 2013 with currently branches operating in three provinces; Gauteng, Western Cape
and Kwa-Zulu Natal. Our foundation has partnered with fifteen schools throughout these provinces
to identify learners in need of financial, tutoring or social support.</p>
